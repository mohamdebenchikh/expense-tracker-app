# Expense Tracking App - Design Document

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the design for a mobile-first expense tracking application prototype. The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for users to log daily expenses, set a monthly budget, categorize spending, and view reports with visualizations.

## 2. User Requirements Recap

- Input daily expenses.
- Set a monthly budget.
- Categorize expenses (e.g., Necessary, Unnecessary).
- Generate weekly and monthly reports.
- Include charts in reports showing spending trends and highlighting high-spending days.

## 3. Application Features

- **Expense Logging:** Allow users to quickly add new expenses with amount, date, category, and an optional description.
- **Budget Management:** Enable users to set and view their monthly budget.
- **Categorization:** Provide predefined categories (Necessary, Unnecessary) and potentially allow users to add custom ones in a future iteration.
- **Data Storage:** Utilize browser's `localStorage` for persistent storage in this prototype.
- **Reporting:** Generate summary reports for weekly and monthly periods.
- **Visualization:** Display charts (e.g., bar or line charts) illustrating spending patterns over time and distribution across categories. Highlight days exceeding average spending.

## 4. User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) Design

### 4.1. General Principles

- **Simplicity:** Clean layout, easy navigation.
- **Mobile-First:** Designed primarily for mobile screens, responsive for larger displays.
- **Clarity:** Clear presentation of financial data and reports.

### 4.2. Key Screens

1.  **Home/Dashboard Screen:**
    *   **Content:**
        *   Current Month's Overview: Display set budget, total spent so far, remaining budget.
        *   Quick Stats: Perhaps total spending for today or the current week.
        *   Recent Expenses: A short list of the last few transactions.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Prominent "Add Expense" button (e.g., a floating action button).
        *   Navigation links/tabs to Reports, Budget Settings.

2.  **Add Expense Screen:**
    *   **Form Fields:**
        *   Amount (Numeric input).
        *   Date (Date picker, defaults to current date).
        *   Category (Dropdown/Radio buttons: Necessary, Unnecessary. Consider adding 'Other' or custom categories later).
        *   Description (Optional text input).
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Save Button: Adds the expense and returns to the home screen or expense list.
        *   Cancel Button: Discards input and returns.

3.  **Set Budget Screen:**
    *   **Content:** Display current monthly budget (if set).
    *   **Form Field:** Input for the new monthly budget amount.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   Save Button: Updates the budget.
        *   Clear Button: Removes the budget.

4.  **Reports Screen:**
    *   **Controls:**
        *   Selector for report period (This Week, Last Week, This Month, Last Month, Custom Range - maybe later).
    *   **Content:**
        *   Summary: Total expenses for the selected period, comparison to budget (if applicable for monthly).
        *   Spending Chart: A bar or line chart showing daily spending totals for the period. Days with spending significantly above the period's average should be visually highlighted (e.g., different color bar).
        *   Category Breakdown: Pie chart or list showing spending distribution by category.
        *   Expense List: Detailed list of all transactions within the selected period.

## 5. Data Model (Conceptual for LocalStorage)

- **Expenses:** Array of objects, each with `id`, `amount`, `date`, `category`, `description`.
- **Budget:** A single value storing the monthly budget amount.

## 6. Technology Considerations (Initial Thoughts)

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Charting:** A library like Chart.js for visualizations.
- **Framework:** Consider a lightweight framework (like Vanilla JS initially, or potentially Vue/React for scalability) or just plain JS for a simple prototype.
- **Deployment:** Can be deployed as a static website or potentially packaged as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an app-like experience.

## 7. Future Considerations

- User accounts and cloud sync.
- Custom categories.
- Recurring expenses.
- Exporting data.
- More advanced reporting filters.
